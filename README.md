# TUTORIAL:
**If you want to manually install this container you can by these simple steps**

1. Add new container under Docker tab.
2. Give the container a name you prefer.
3. Add ``` mdarkness1988/rust-server ``` in Repository.
4. Add the variables you want from the list below.
5. Add ports to container, (8080/TCP, 28015/TCP&UDP, 28016/TCP).
6. Save Template and RUN :)

**NOTE**: This image will install/update on startup. The path ```/steamcmd/rust``` can be mounted on the host for data persistence.  
Also note that this image provides the new web-based RCON, so you should set ```RUST_RCON_PASSWORD``` to a more secure password.
This image also supports having a modded server (using Oxide), check the ```RUST_OXIDE_ENABLED``` variable below.


The following environment variables are available if you wish to modify the template:

# Logging and rotating logs

The image now supports log rotation, and all you need to do to enable it is to remove any `-logfile` arguments from your startup arguments.
Log files will be created under `logs/` with the server identity and the current date and time.
When the server starts up or restarts, it will move old logs to `logs/archive/`.

# How to send or receive command to/from the server

A small application, called *rcon*, that can both send and receive messages to the server, much like the console on the Windows version, but this happens to use RCON (webrcon).
To use it, simply run the following on the host: `docker exec rust-server rcon say Hello World`, substituting *rust-server* for your own container name
